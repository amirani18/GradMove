"1. Number of abortions is from 2009; expenditures are estimated using the average spending per abortion in the other nonrestrictive states ($375). Notes: State policies are as of the middle of FY 2010 (April 1, 2010). States with nonrestrictive policies use their own funds to pay for most or all medically necessary abortions provided to Medicaid recipients; the policy may have been adopted either voluntarily or because of a court order. States with restrictive policies pay for abortions only in a few circumstances: when necessary to save the life of the woman or when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest (which is federal policy); only to save the life of the woman (a violation of federal policy); or , 2. For these states, the number of unplanned births and the proportion of planned and unplanned births that were publicly funded were estimated by regression analyses., 3. Rounded to the nearest 10., 4. Abortion clinics are health care facilities other than hospitals and physicians’ offices that provide abortion care. Physicians’ offices that provided 400 or more abortions in a calendar year are also counted as clinics., 5. nr=no response or not available. , 6. Includes savings from other HPV-attributable cancer cases averted in addition to cervical cancer., 7. Numerator includes all abortions to residents of each state, regardless of patient’s age at outcome., 8. Rounded to the nearest 10. State totals do not sum to US total because of the small number of residents of US territories or other countries who have abortions in the 50 states or the District of Columbia., 9. u = unavailable, 10. n/a = not applicable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
